Note: the trained layers are already in training/layers.txt so compiling this is not actually necessary unless you want to alter parameters and retrain the model

1. Retrieve the dataset from https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset, decompress the data, and place the relevant training and testing sets in images (i.e. "images/emnist-digits-train-images-idx3-ubyte"). I did not include this data in the repository because it is too large.
2. Configure the MLP in main as needed.
3. Install the Eigen library and compile all files from the training folder. The executable should be created directly in the MLP folder.
4. Run the executable. It should write the layers to backend/layers.txt. The written layers can be used from mlp.py.
